With this code you can check your total points in https://t.me/dogshouse_bot/join?startapp=c1UCL7j6Q0Kft3-6DawdNw

id.txt - put there your telegram accs ids, yo ucan check it in @userinfobot
proxies.txt - proxy format should be login:pass@ip:port
useragent - just put here useragent for use :D

The number of lines in the files should coincide, for example: in the file id.txt you put 30 ids from your Telegram accounts, so in the files useragent.txt and proxies.txt should also be 30 useragents and proxies respectively.
